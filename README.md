# Utils.java
Contains three methods to parse the HTML content in the required result.


# Tenth character (White space and new line are not excluded)
Just read the content as string and get the ninth index of it.

# Every tenth character (White space and new line are not excluded)
Divide the whole content string in the group of ten and read the last character of each group.

# Count every unique word without considering (Excluding White space and new line)
Split the whole content string with regex of white spaces and new lines, which will return an array.

Insert every element of the array in ArrayMap which will remove all the duplicates.

Iterate over every Entry to get the required output
